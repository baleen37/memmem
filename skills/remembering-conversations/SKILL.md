# Remembering Conversations

**Core principle:** Search before reinventing. Searching costs nothing; reinventing or repeating mistakes costs everything.

## Mandatory: Use the Search Agent

**YOU MUST dispatch the search-conversation agent for any historical search.**

Announce: "Dispatching search agent to find [topic]."

Then use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "search-conversation"`:

```text
Task tool:
  description: "Search past conversations for [topic]"
  prompt: "Search for [specific query or topic]. Focus on [what you're looking for - e.g., decisions, patterns, gotchas, code examples]."
  subagent_type: "search-conversation"
```

The agent will use **progressive disclosure** (3 layers):

1. **Layer 1: search()** - Returns compact observations (~30t each)
   - Fast discovery of relevant insights from past sessions

2. **Layer 2: get_observations()** - Full observation details (~200-500t each)
   - Complete context: narrative, concepts, files, decisions
   - Most searches stop here - this is usually enough

3. **Layer 3: read()** - Raw conversation transcript (~500-2000t)
   - Full dialogue when you need the complete rationale
   - Use only when layers 1-2 don't provide enough context

The agent will:
- Search with the `search` tool (observations for single-concept)
- Get full details with `get_observations` for top results
- Read raw conversations only if needed (rare)
- Synthesize findings (200-1000 words)
- Return actionable insights + sources

**Saves 50-100x context vs. loading raw conversations.**

## When to Use

You often get value out of consulting your episodic memory once you understand what you're being asked. Search memory
in these situations:

**After understanding the task:**

- User asks "how should I..." or "what's the best approach..."
- You've explored current codebase and need to make architectural decisions
- User asks for implementation approach after describing what they want

**When you're stuck:**

- You've investigated a problem and can't find the solution
- Facing a complex problem without obvious solution in current code
- Need to follow an unfamiliar workflow or process

**When historical signals are present:**

- User says "last time", "before", "we discussed", "you implemented"
- User asks "why did we...", "what was the reason..."
- User says "do you remember...", "what do we know about..."

**Don't search first:**

- For current codebase structure (use Grep/Read to explore first)
- For info in current conversation
- Before understanding what you're being asked to do

## Direct Tool Access (Discouraged)

You CAN use MCP tools directly, but **DON'T**:

- `mcp__plugin_memmem_memmem__search`
- `mcp__plugin_memmem_memmem__read`

Using these directly wastes your context window. **Always dispatch the agent instead.**

See [MCP-TOOLS.md](./MCP-TOOLS.md) for complete API reference if needed for advanced usage.

## Legacy: How to Search (Discouraged)

**Note:** This section describes direct MCP tool usage, which is discouraged. Use the search-conversation agent instead.

Use the MCP tools provided by memmem plugin:

### Step 1: Search

Use `mcp__plugin_memmem_memmem__search` to find relevant conversations:

```typescript
{
  query: "React Router authentication errors",  // Single concept
  mode: "both",  // "vector" | "text" | "both" (default)
  limit: 10      // Max results (1-50, default: 10)
}
```

**Multi-concept AND search** (finds conversations containing ALL concepts):

```typescript
{
  query: ["authentication", "React Router", "error handling"],
  limit: 10
}
```

**Date filtering:**

```typescript
{
  query: "refactoring patterns",
  after: "2025-09-01",   // YYYY-MM-DD
  before: "2025-10-01"
}
```

### Step 2: Read Details

Use `mcp__plugin_memmem_memmem__read` to view full conversations:

```typescript
{
  path: "/path/from/search/results/conversation.jsonl"
}
```

**Paginate large conversations:**

```typescript
{
  path: "/path/to/conversation.jsonl",
  startLine: 100,  // 1-indexed
  endLine: 200
}
```

## Search Strategy

1. **Start broad**, then narrow:
   - First: `{ query: "authentication" }`
   - Then: `{ query: ["authentication", "JWT", "Express"] }`

2. **Use text mode for exact terms**:
   - IDs, error codes, exact phrases: `{ query: "ERR_AUTH_FAILED", mode: "text" }`

3. **Check top 2-5 results**:
   - Read snippets from search results
   - Use `read` tool for promising conversations
   - Focus on decisions, gotchas, patterns

4. **Synthesize findings**:
   - Summarize key insights (200-1000 words)
   - Include source paths and dates
   - Extract actionable recommendations

## Search Modes

- **`vector`** - Semantic similarity (best for concepts, ideas)
- **`text`** - Exact text matching (best for IDs, codes, exact phrases)
- **`both`** - Combined search (default, recommended for general use)

## Performance Tips

- Search is fast (< 100ms typically)
- Read can be slow for large conversations - use pagination
- Multi-concept search is more precise but may return fewer results
- Text search is case-insensitive

## Example Workflow

```text
User: "How should we implement authentication in the new API?"

1. Understand context:
   - Read current API code
   - Check existing auth patterns

2. Search memory:
   {
     query: ["authentication", "API", "JWT"],
     limit: 10
   }

3. Review top results:
   - Read 2-3 most relevant conversations
   - Note past decisions and rationale

4. Synthesize:
   - Summarize findings
   - Apply to current context
   - Recommend approach with sources
```

## Important Notes

- **Use the agent** - always dispatch search-conversation agent, never use MCP tools directly
- **Search costs nothing** - always check before reinventing
- **Past mistakes are valuable** - learn from failed approaches
- **Context matters** - past decisions may not apply to new situations
- **Sources are essential** - always cite conversation paths and dates
- **Agent saves 50-100x context** - synthesized insights vs. raw conversation data
